# Introduction

The Student Performance Prediction Project is an exploration of machine learning techniques applied to a dataset designed to analyze the factors influencing academic student performance. This dataset contains records for 10,000 students, each with various predictors and a performance index.

# Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to gain insights into the relationships between various factors and a student's academic performance. Understanding these relationships can help educators and researchers improve the learning experience and provide targeted support to students. We aim to uncover patterns that can contribute to more effective educational strategies.

# About the Dataset

 Context

 The Student Performance Dataset is designed to examine the factors influencing academic student performance. The dataset consists of 10,000 student records, with each record containing information about various predictors and a performance index. By analyzing this dataset, we hope to contribute to the broader discussion of how educators can enhance student outcomes.

 Content

 The dataset includes the following variables:

- **Hours Studied**: The total number of hours spent studying by each student.
  
- **Previous Scores**: The scores obtained by students in previous tests.
  
- **Extracurricular Activities**: Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities (Yes or No).
  
- **Sleep Hours**: The average number of hours of sleep the student had per day.
  
- **Sample Question Papers Practiced**: The number of sample question papers the student practiced.

- **Performance Index**: A measure of the overall performance of each student, ranging from 10 to 100, with higher values indicating better performance.
